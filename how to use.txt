Step 1:

    In this code I have used 3 subjects you can use how many subjects you want

    But remember to add folders s04,s05, etc (or delete)based on number of subjects in photos folder
    and in cropped faces folder add empty folders named s04,s05, etc based on number of subjects
    First run capturefacesfromvideo.m to get training data. 

    If you have training data paste the images of subject 1 in photos\s01 and subject 2 in photos\s02
    and so on and please skip to Step 2.

    I have set to run loop for 300 times which means we get around 300 images for 1 subject
    You can change this threshold it is mentioned in code change it according to how much training
    data you need.

    And in capturefacesfromvideo.m change the string str = 's01' to str = 's02','s03', etc for each 
    subject and run it to get training  data for all subjects this will automatically store the data for a 
    subject in photos\s01 folder for str='s01' and so on for all subject you just need to change the str
    (which is mentioned in the code).


Step 2:

    Now in SimpleFaceRecognition.m change the value of n which is number of subjects or
    number of persons.

    and run it. It will automatically crop faces in data which is in photos folder for each subject 
    and if faces are detected it stores cropped faces in croppedfaces\s01 for subject 1 and so on.
    and it will resize the image for input size of Neural Network.

    and it will train the neural network I have set learning rate as 0.00001 you can change this if you
    want and it will start to train and it will show the process of training.

    you can see the training process and can manually stop it if the accuracy reaches you desired
    level (press stop button at top right corner besides number of iterations of dialog box to stop it).
    and it will show the accuracy of test data.
Step 3:
   Now let's test a new image (It is also mentioned in the code)
   use code below with giving path to your new image
   face value is 1 when it detects face in image or 0

   here I have done it for 3 subjects you can change this based on number of subjects.

(
	nameofs01 = 'name of subject 1';
	nameofs02 = 'name of subject 2';
	nameofs03 = 'name of subject 3';
	img = imread('...\img.jpg');
	[img,face] = cropface(img);
	if face == 1
    		img = imresize(img,[227 227]);
    		predict = classify(newnet,img);
	else
		fprintf('No face detected \n');
 	end
	if predict=='s01'
    		fprintf('The face detected is %s \n',nameofs01);
	elseif  predict=='s02'
   		fprintf('The face detected is %s \n',nameofs02);
	elseif  predict=='s03'
   		fprintf('The face detected is %s \n',nameofs03);
	end
)

can use [predict,score] = classify(newnet,img) and fprintf('The face detected is %s with accuracy %f ',nameofs01,scores(str2num(predict(3))));
here score says the percentage that how confidence it is.
