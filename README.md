# SimpleFaceRecognition
Face recognition from training pretrained neural network alexnet and using cascade object detector for cropping faces.
Using capturefacesfromvideo.m to get training data from video and saving images of faces.
And using cropface.m to crop faces from images from training data.
And training Convolutional Neural Network alexnet by modifying output layesrs by number of subjects and using rmsprop optimizer.
Using trained newnet for face recognition.
